# What is it like to work at Microsoft? Managers, atmosphere, organization, in-kind benefits, salaries, etc.

When you get the offer, you feel excited, proud and validated.
After all, you to get a chance to work at a company that created products like Windows and Office which practically everybody uses.

There is exciting work to do, and tremendous opportunities to learn. There are smart people all around you who will go out of their way to help you. You're not just given a task to do and asked to finish it as soon as possible. You are explained (or you have to figure it out if you're a PM) why it's important. And you decide how it should be done. If you're a Program Manager or interested in becoming one, this is the best company to be a PM in. The discipline was invented here, you know.
Career advancement is clear. Do your job well and keep learning the skills required at the next level. If there aren't openings in your team, moving to another isn't hard.

Microsoft treats its employees really well. You can tell from the well stocked pantry with biscuits, fruits, soft drinks, many kinds of tea and coffee, horlicks, soup, hot chocolate. You can play TT, pool, Xbox, foosball or chess when you need a break. I've been given a lumia 820 phone, a tablet, a carbon X1 laptop, JBL portable speaker, a travel bag and numerous T-shirts. I'm able to cycle to office because the office gym has showers and because of the work-life balance here that gives me the time to do so. Do not underestimate the impact daily exercise has on your productivity, health, stress levels and sense of well being. Unlike most places I've heard of, you don't have to ask your manager for leaves. You just inform him/her. Business continuity is your manager's concern, not yours.

It does sadden you to see journalists sometimes bashing the company. But the company is transforming now. And it's best days are ahead of it.

It's always gratifying (and fun) to see the reaction of people when your reply to "Where do you work" is"Microsoft"

Some are impressed,

Some try to act cool about it.

Nobody ignores it.
